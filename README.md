# cdda-TDG-mod
Attempt at integrating "The Daily Grind" novel with Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

Working off the backrooms mod by TGWeaver, Monster descriptions and butcher messages by NemoTheAxolotl.

Lovam and Candlebury helped with generating mutable map specials, thank you!
 
-features as of now

	-most of the stuff from the backrooms mod
	-4 creatures
		-strider - a living stapler, a small jumping spider-like creature which uses hit-n-run tactics against the enemy, usually in packs
		-shellaxy - An ambush computer with a deadly bite, roams the halls for now, in the future it will ambush the player in the cubicles
		-tumblefeed - A slithering mass of cables with grappling attacks.
		-paper pusher - Your coworker, will rip your arm off.
	-orbs
		-yellow orbs give one level in a random skill
		-small yellow orbs give around 50% progress in a random proficiency
		-blue orbs "solve" problems, currently they can patch you up and make you less tired
		-green orbs "upgrade" areas, for now it's stuff like their structural integrity or giving you buffs while you're in them
			-buffs like
				-focus area - reading and/or learning stuff here is super easy.
				-sleepless area - sleep need not apply, your rest falls slower while in here.
				-regeneration area - you heal faster here, as if you had the "regeneration" mutation
		-purple orbs "upgrade" your body, this just means you get semi-random mutations, or in some cases a random skill.
	-xenotech
		-xeno coffeemaker can create xeno coffee, a super useful buff to help combat the office monsters
			-check in OTHER/OFFICE for recipe
			-can be randomly found where coffeemakers usually are
	-a strange door
		-you can find it while wandering the fields, it's extremely rare
		-first usage teleports you to a random chamber in the offices
		-next usages should teleport you to the last door you used to exit the dimension
	-exit
		-a metal door, use it to return to the door you used to enter the dimension.
	-decision tree
		-can rarely be found in the offices
		-you can use it to exchange your yellow orbs for purple orbs.
		-The exchange rate is "80 small yellow / 20 regular yellow = 1 purple"
		-Open the suggestions :p
	-decision forests
		-can be found while wandering the offices
		-pools of pen ink cover the floors, only illumination are the trees themselves and the LEDs on the walls.
	-Ink sea

		-a sea of ink, will eventually contain fish
		-plastic beach, which one will be able to dig up for materials
