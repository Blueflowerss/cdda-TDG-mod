# cdda-TDG-mod

	-3 creatures

	-orbs
		-yellow orbs give one level in a random skill
		-small yellow orbs give around 50% progress in a random proficiency
		-blue orbs "solve" problems, currently they can patch you up and make you less tired
		-green orbs "upgrade" areas, for now it's stuff like their structural integrity or giving you buffs while you're in them
			-buffs like
				-focus area - reading and/or learning stuff here is super easy.
				-sleepless area - sleep need not apply, your rest falls slower while in here.
				-regeneration area - you heal faster here, as if you had the "regeneration" mutation
		-purple orbs "upgrade" your body, this just means you get semi-random mutations, or in some cases a random skill.
	-xenotech
		-xeno coffeemaker can create xeno coffee, a super useful buff to help combat the office monsters
			-check in OTHER/OFFICE for recipe
			-can be randomly found where coffeemakers usually are
	-a strange door
		-you can find it while wandering the fields, it's extremely rare
		-first usage teleports you to a random chamber in the offices
		-next usages should teleport you to the last door you used to exit the dimension
	-exit
		-a metal door, use it to return to the door you used to enter the dimension.
